People are willing to pay monthly subscription fees just to watch one of the most popular TV shows at the moment. So how is it doing on the Stock Market?

## ●Business Problem●
▶ DailyMarket Co. is a start up mobile app company that provides stock market information such as forecasting the stock price. Company has hired a team to provide the most accurate forecasting on stock market closing prices. As a team member of the company, I will be doing Netflix Analysis and Predictions from 12 months to 36 months.
